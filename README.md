# **Pawn: Chessify Your Life**

## **Overview**
**Real life is chess.** In chess, you master the game by foreseeing **dozens of moves ahead**—now, with **Pawn**, you can **Chessify your life**. They say life is too complex to be reduced to a game of chess. **I’m here to prove them wrong.**

**Pawn** is a chess-based life simulation where every real-world achievement is a strategic move, recorded and verified through **NFTs on the Solana blockchain**. Whether you’re a **leader of a nation** or a **lowlife in the slums**, **there is always a best move to make.** Every man starts as a pawn. But only those who **survive the game, make the right moves, and go through hell** will **become kings.**

## **Features**
- **Real-Life Progression:** Start as a **pawn** and progress based on actual achievements—academic, professional, fitness-related, or personal milestones.
- **NFT Integration (Solana Blockchain):** Achievements are minted as **NFTs**, serving as digital proof of progress and unlocking stronger chess pieces.
- **Strategic Foresight & Decision-Making:** Train your mind to **foresee moves, recognize patterns, and execute smarter choices** both in-game and in real life.
- **AI-Powered Opponent & Best Move Suggestions (Upcoming):** Implementing **Stockfish AI, AlphaZero-like reinforcement learning**, and **Monte Carlo Tree Search** to guide strategic decision-making.
- **Decentralized & Verifiable Achievements:** Blockchain ensures accomplishments are **immutable and globally recognized**.

## **How It Works**
1. **Track Achievements** → Life milestones trigger an **NFT minting process** on Solana.
2. **Mint & Store NFTs** → Achievements are minted as **SPL NFTs** and linked to the player’s wallet.
3. **Chess Piece Progression** → The game verifies NFTs to determine **piece upgrades (Pawn → Knight → Bishop → Queen → King)**.
4. **Simulated Decision-Making** → AI-powered foresight allows users to simulate **best moves in life, career, or strategy**.
